## How to Play

In the game we will flip cards to check which animal is underneath and match it with another card with the same image.
We flip by left clicking on a card followed by clicking on another card.
In the case when you don't flip the same two cards the cards will flip back to its original state and you have to remember what cards they were.
If you are able to flip the same two cards they will be saved and you can then continue on with the next two flips until you've found all the pairs.
